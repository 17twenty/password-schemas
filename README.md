## Password Schemas ##

Annoyed by the never ending list of onerous password requirements? Getting locked out regularly because you forgot that you had to take your strong unique password and add a special and uppercase character? This is for you.

The end goal is to categorise these on a seperate site or to roll them into a browser plugin.

| Site  | Requirements | Lock out on incorrect empty |
|---|---|---|
| www.twilio.com  | > 8 Characters, and 3 of the following; 1 UPPER CASE, 1 lower case, 1 special, 1 number | No |
